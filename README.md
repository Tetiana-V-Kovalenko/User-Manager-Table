# User Manager Table

This project is a test task to create a dynamic table displaying user information such as name, username, email, and phone number. The table data is fetched from JSONPlaceholder and displayed using a modern tech stack to ensure fast development and efficient state management.

## Features

- **Table Display**: Shows `name`, `username`, `email`, and `phone` columns.
- **Advanced Filtering**: The table supports filtering on each column (`name`,`username`, `email`, `phone`). Filters are applied dynamically, with real-time updates to the displayed data.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit is used for centralized state management.
- **Data Fetching**: RTK Query is used to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API.
- **Table Rendering**: TanStack Table is used to create the responsive and performant table.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for fast and efficient styling.
- **Bundling**: Vite is used to build the project with quick startup times and hot reloading.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Core framework for building the UI.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and better development tools.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
- **RTK Query**: For handling API requests and caching.
- **TanStack Table**: For building the table.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Vite**: For fast development and building.
